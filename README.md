            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3 id="history">History</h3>
            <p>Concepcion Holy Cross College (CHCC), Inc. is a private, Catholic school located in Concepcion Tarlac. Founded in 1995 by Pablo L. Tioseco, Sr. and his daughter, Dr. Raquel T. Sta. Ines, CHCC was established to provide students in Concepcion and neighboring areas the opportunity to earn their degrees without having to travel far. The college initially offered courses in Teacher Education, Computer Science, and Business Administration, including Secretarial courses. Four years later, the preschool and elementary departments were established, further expanding the educational offerings of the institution.</p>

            <h3 id="official">Official Statement</h3>
            <p>The administration is grateful to those who appreciate all its efforts and hard work. For those who have valid concerns, we will address these matters in a proper forum. As an institution imbued with public interest, we have grown receptive of criticisms in the appropriate context that aid in the development and progress of the institution and ultimately for the benefit of our students. Rest assured that the institution will serve and respond accordingly. However, accusations that are factually inaccurate and intended solely to malign the institution will be dealt with accordingly. The administration and all of its community will continue to give credit where it is due, and accord respect to those who deserve it.</p>

            <h3 id="mission">Mission:</h3>
            <p>To become a leading God-centered learning institution focused on holistic education that forms and educates individuals to become conscientious, competent, compassionate, and committed persons towards the development of a just and humane society.</p>

            <h3 id="vision">Vision:</h3>
            <p>Holy Cross Concepcion College Inc., is an institution for academic and values formation offering relevant, learner-centered, and values-oriented programs that produce competent persons of character in the service of society. These mission and vision statements serve as guiding principles for our institution, reflecting our commitment to excellence, holistic development, and service to the community.</p>
